;;; a.el --- Utility functions for dealing with alists

;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((dash "1.2.0"))

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; a.el is meant to provide a useful set of utility functions for
;; alists in emacs.  Initially inspired by the frustration of typing
;; (cdr (assoc 'key alist)) everytime I simply wanted a-get.  Alists
;; aren't particularly fast, especially at larger sizes, so use them
;; and this library where it makes sense.
