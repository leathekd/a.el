* a.el

a.el is a small collection of utility functions for dealing with
alists in elisp and Emacs.

** Status

Some of the initial functions that you might expect, like:
  - =a-put= : put an element into an alist
  - =a-get= : get an element from an alist
  - =a-remove= : remove an element from an alist
  - =a-get-in= : get an element from within an nested alist structure
  - =a-keys= : get a list of the keys for the alist
  - =a-vals= : get a list of the vals in the alist
  - =a-merge= : merge multiple alists
  - =a-into= : turn a list of lists into an alist

* Installation

a.el is still a work-in-progress and can currently only be installed
by hand.  Once it has received a little breaking in it will be added
to Marmalade and Melpa for easier installation.

** Manually

Download a.el and put it somewhere in the Emacs load path.  Put the
following in your init.el or .emacs file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'a)
#+END_SRC

a.el requires the dash.el library located at:
